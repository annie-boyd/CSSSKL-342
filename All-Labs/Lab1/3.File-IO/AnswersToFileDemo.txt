1. argc and argv are used so that a user can input command-line
arguments at startup instead of prompting the user later on
int argc stores the number of commands, including 1 for running the program,
char* argv[] is an array with each command-line argument representing one element

2. The default behavior when writing to a file is to overrwrite, but options 
include ios::trunc to truncate, and ios::app to append.

3. int top and int bottom are declared but not initialized until later,
so at line 41 the starting value for both is 0.
